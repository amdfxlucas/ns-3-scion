why doesnt the number of borderRouters correspond to the number of netDevices of a ScionAs ?
There are as many NetDevices per AS as links, but borderRouters have to be specified in the topology explicitly.


Do i need to have a beaconService in my .yaml config to discover paths ?! probably yes

But a BorderRouter is not required for this. Dont confuse them.


can a ScionCapableNode be connected to more than one ScionAs !? i dont think so 


Can ScionCapableNodes exchange Messages without being introduced to one another via AddToRemoteNodesInfo() first ?!
