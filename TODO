there is no notion of TTL in the scion impl now


why doesn't the PathSegment know its PathSegmentType ?!

Beacon should have methods for DestinationAS and Originator() instead of c-like macros


what is the use of PathSegment.reverse ?! it is only logged, but not considered by any decisions 
NO, see scion-capable-node.cc line 183
it is ultimately involved in the computation of local_if_to_send which is then used in:
ScheduleForSend( local_if_to_send, packet )



maybe add method 'isPacketForMe( ScionPacket* )' to ScionCapableNode
that does NS_ASSERT(packet->dst_ia == ia_addr && packet->dst_host == GetLocalAddress() ); this check

in path-server.h the members:
   cached_path_segs_dataset_t cached_core_segments;
    cached_path_segs_dataset_t cached_up_segments;
    cached_path_segs_dataset_t cached_down_segments; are not used for anything yet


add strongTypes ! everything is uint16_t AS-Numbers, AS-Interface IDs, Node-Interface_IDs ..
